## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot of things from this project. First, I learned the process behind building a chrome extension, which was an exciting experience. I also learned how to create animated buttons that change colors when turning ON and OFF using CSS, adding a nice touch to the UI. 

To be honest, most of the Javascript portion was a significant learning experience since it was my first time working with Chrome APIs. For example, I learned out how to check if the URL is allowed, loop through each Chrome tab to ensure it updates with the button's status, and much more. 

Overall, this project was a great experience that will help to grow my skills and expand my knowledge of front-end development. It might even be my introduction to making more Chrome extensions!
